# Deep-Shading
CS 7643 - Deep Learning Final Project

## We might work locally at first. Collaborate via Git (Tortoise Git is recommended).

## Run our model on small dataset to validate locally before moving everything to Google Cloud.

## Do not commit large amount of data (a few sample images is ok)

## To-do List
* Load exr images into neural network
* Implement network in PyTorch
* Add train.py to adjust learning rate, hyperparameters and save model snapshots
* Use our own scene/models (optional)
* Augment training images (optional)
* Run on Unity or other real-time rendering systems (in the future)
